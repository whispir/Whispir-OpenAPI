## REST architecture

The Whispir API adheres to the [REST architectural style.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)

Our REST API is built around simple-to-understand resource-oriented URLs. To use the API, you will perform standard REST API methods including `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`.

## What can I do with the Whispir API?

The Whispir API enables developers to:

- Create, send and retrieve multi-channel messages over 8 different channels.
- Invoke scenario-based communications for quick, effective and targeted communications.
- Publish messages to internal or external web pages, RSS feeds and social networks.
- Asynchronously receive all responses to a given message and perform analysis on the data.
- Create rich, cross-channel message templates that can be managed by designers within the Whispir Rich Message Studio.
- Create, update and delete distribution lists that can be accessed for messaging at a later date.

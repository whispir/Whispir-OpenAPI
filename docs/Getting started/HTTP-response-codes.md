# HTTP response codes

Application clients that are using Whispir’s API will receive HTTP response codes in response to every request that is issued.

The table below describes the response codes that will be issued and gives potential reasons for why they may have been sent back.

## Successful response codes

| Response Code             | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **415 Unsupported Media Type** | The request was unsuccessful because the requested content type is not supported by the API. <br /><br />The application client can use this response to determine if it's asking for a supported version of a resource. On receiving this response the client can query the developer documentation to determine the appropriate version for the requested resource. <br /><br />In most cases, this is due to the user not supplying the correct Accept or Content-Type header for the requested URL. <br /><br />See [JSON and XML Headers](JSON-and-XML-headers.md) for more details |
